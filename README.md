**A 100% free and open-source competition and community platform** focused on games. Communities create games, organize leagues and tournaments in many formats (Elo, round robin, elimination, Swiss, group stage, and more), build teams and clans, and interact through forums and customizable profiles - all with no paywall.

> Public repository that also serves as an architecture reference for a modern monorepo with Next.js + NestJS + GraphQL + Prisma. Open to contributors and sustained by the community.

## What It Is

- Users sign in through Discord OAuth
- Anyone can create a game and organize competitions inside it
- **Leagues** with two modes: **Elo** (dynamic rating with K-factor, score relevance, and inactivity decay) or **Points** (win/draw/loss with configurable scoring)
- **Tournaments** with brackets: single elimination, double elimination, Swiss system, group stage, and custom stage composition
- Matches can be **scheduled** or have **results recorded** with format, score, and optional proof (image, YouTube, Twitch)
- Event creators define **custom per-match data** (kills, assists, damage, and so on) through dynamic forms
- **Teams and Clans**: create multi-player squads and track collective rankings
- **Forums and posts** on user, game, and event pages
- **Highly customizable profiles** - each player's personal "temple", inspired by Discord and Steam
- **Notifications and invites** for events, plus event moderation staff
- **Administrative panel** for admins and moderators
- Real-time ranking with aggressive page caching
- **100% free forever** - open source, sustained by sponsors and donations
